# Health Mistrust and Sleep Analysis

**Associations Between Mistrust in Professional Health Information, Preventive Behavior, and Sleep Quality in a Multilingual Population**

This repository documents the analysis code and macrodata from a population-based study investigating how mistrust toward professional health information relates to sleep quality and preventive behavior in South Tyrol, a linguistically and culturally diverse region of northern Italy. The study explores direct and indirect (mediated) pathways using regression and mediation analysis.

## Objectives

- Analyze associations between mistrust in professional health information and sleep quality  
- Assess whether preventive health behaviors mediate this relationship  
- Evaluate the role of sociodemographic and health characteristics in explaining mistrust and behavior variation  
- Inform public health strategies that address mistrust as a modifiable psychosocial determinant of sleep health
